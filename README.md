**The Last Class: IADE's Final Mystery**

This project was developed for the Project V course, where the objective was to create a virtual reality experience based on IADE's old campus. As IADE prepares to move to a new, modern campus next year, this VR experience explores the legacy of the old building. Players solve puzzles, uncover clues, and convince three students—representing Design, Technology, and Communication—to embrace the future while preserving IADE’s creative spirit.
