Project V - VR Game - The Last Class: IADE's Final Mystery

Synopsis:
On the eve of IADE's move to a new, modern campus, three students disappear without a trace. Each of them, representing a key area of the institution - Design, Technology and Communication - hides in the heart of the old building, believing that the history and essence of IADE will be forgotten with the move.

As the explorer assigned to solve the mystery, you begin an immersive journey through the corridors and floors of the campus, following clues left by students. Historical objects, old assignments and riddles related to your fields of study guide you through each floor, revealing the motivations behind your escape.

As you progress, the real reason behind your disappearance becomes clear: a deep desire to preserve the memories and stories built within the old campus. However, his mission is not only to find them, but to convince them that the move to the new building will not erase IADE's legacy - it will live on through the students, projects and the very history they helped build.

In the end, by reuniting the three students, you guide them to the new campus, where together they will continue to write IADE's next chapter, now aware that history will always accompany them.
